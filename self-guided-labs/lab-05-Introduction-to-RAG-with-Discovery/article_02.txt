Cucumbers are fun to grow for beginning gardeners and advanced gardeners alike.  There are two types of cucumbers: slicing and pickling.  Pickling cucumbers are smaller than slicing cucumbers.  Cucumber plants come in two types: vining cucumbers, which are more common, and bush cucumbers.  Vining cucumbers, which can grow to more than 5 feet tall, grow fast, yield lots of fruit, and you can train them up a trellis.  Growing cucumbers up a trellis or fence can maximize garden space, keep fruit clean, and make it easier to harvest the fruit.  Tropical plants, cucumbers are very sensitive to frost or cold weather. Cucumbers prefer full sun for 6 to 8 hours per day.  Cucumbers need constant watering.  Cucumbers can grow quickly and ripen in just 6 weeks.  Harvest cucumbers every day or two because the more you harvest, the more the plant will produce.  If any cucumber is left on the vine to fully mature, the plant will stop producing more cucumbers.  You can extend the harvest season by planting cucumbers in batches, 2 weeks apart.
