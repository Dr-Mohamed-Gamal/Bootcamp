Cucumber plants come in two types: vining cucumbers, which are more common, and bush cucumbers.  Vining cucumbers, which can grow to more than 5 feet tall, grow fast, yield lots of fruit, and you can train them up a trellis.  Growing cucumbers up a trellis or fence can maximize garden space, keep fruit clean, and make it easier to harvest the fruit.  Tropical plants, cucumbers are very sensitive to frost or cold weather. Cucumbers prefer full sun for 6 to 8 hours per day.  Cucumbers need constant watering.  Cucumbers can grow quickly and ripen in just 6 weeks.  Harvest cucumbers every day or two because the more you harvest, the more the plant will produce.  If any cucumber is left on the vine to fully mature, the plant will stop producing more cucumbers.  You can extend the harvest season by planting cucumbers in batches, 2 weeks apart.\n","###\n","\n","Answer the following question using only information from the article. \n","Answer in a complete sentence, with proper capitalization and punctuation. \n","If there is no good answer in the article, say \"I don't know\".\n","\n","Question: what are the types of cucumbers?\n","Answer: \n","\n"]}],"source":["question = \"what are the types of cucumbers?\"\n","\n","article_txt = article_02\n","\n","augmented_prompt = augment( prompt_template, article_txt, question )\n","\n","print( augmented_prompt )"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<a id=\"generate\"></a>\n","## Step 5: Generate output using the foundation models Python library\n","\n","You can prompt foundation models in watsonx.ai programmatically using the Python library.\n","\n","See:\n","- <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-python-lib.html?context=wx&audience=wdp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener no referrer\">Introduction to the foundation models Python library</a>\n","- <a href=\"https://ibm.github.io/watson-machine-learning-sdk/foundation_models.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener no referrer\">Foundation models Python library reference</a>\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":78,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","from ibm_watson_machine_learning.foundation_models import Model\n","\n","model_id = \"google/flan-t5-xxl\"\n","\n","gen_parms = { \n","    \"DECODING_METHOD\" : \"greedy\", \n","    \"MIN_NEW_TOKENS\" : 1, \n","    \"MAX_NEW_TOKENS\" : 50 \n","}\n","PROJECT_ID = \"838be5fc-4383-452e-937f-4d33516b6232\"\n","g_wml_project_id = PROJECT_ID\n","\n","model = Model( model_id, g_credentials, gen_parms, g_wml_project_id )"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":79,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def generate( model_in, augmented_prompt_in ):\n","    \n","    generated_response = model_in.generate( augmented_prompt_in )\n","\n","    if ( \"results\" in generated_response ) \\\n","       and ( len( generated_response[\"results\"] ) > 0 ) \\\n","       and ( \"generated_text\" in generated_response[\"results\"][0] ):\n","        return generated_response[\"results\"][0][\"generated_text\"]\n","    else:\n","        print( \"The model failed to generate an answer\" )\n","        print( \"\\nDebug info:\\n\" + json.dumps( generated_response, indent=3 ) )\n","        return \"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":80,"metadata":{"scrolled":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["slicing and pickling\n"]}],"source":["output = generate( model, augmented_prompt )\n","print( output )"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<a id=\"rag\"></a>\n","## Step 6: Pull everything together to perform retrieval-augmented generation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["If you are using VSCODE:\n","Click on extensions icon in the righ bar and make sure Code Runner is installed.\n","Type Code Runner in the search bar\n","Scroll down and check on Code-runner: Run In Terminal"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":81,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import re\n","\n","def searchAndAnswer( model ):\n","    \n","    question = input( \"Type your question:\\n\")\n","    if not re.match( r\"\\S+\", question ):\n","        print( \"No question\")\n","        return\n","        \n","    # Retrieve the relevant content\n","    top_match = search( question )\n","    if top_match is None:\n","        print( \"No good answer was found in the knowledge base\" )\n","        return;\n","    article_text = top_match[\"text\"]\n","    \n","    # Augment a prompt with context\n","    augmented_prompt = augment( prompt_template, article_text, question )\n","    \n","    # Generate output\n","    output = generate( model, augmented_prompt )\n","    if not re.match( r\"\\S+\", output ):\n","        print( \"The model failed to generate an answer\")\n","    print( \"\\nAnswer:\\n\" + output )\n","    print( \"\\nSource: \\\"\" + top_match[\"title\"] + \"\\\", \" + top_match[\"author\"] + \" (\" + top_match[\"published\"] + \")\"  )"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Test the solution by running the following cell multiple times.  \n","\n","\\*You will be prompted to enter a question each time."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":82,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Cucumbers are fun to grow for beginning gardeners and advanced gardeners alike.
