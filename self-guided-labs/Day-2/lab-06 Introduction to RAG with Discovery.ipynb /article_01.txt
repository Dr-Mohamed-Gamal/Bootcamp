Tomatoes are one of the most popular plants for vegetable gardens.  Tip for success: If you select varieties that are resistant to disease and pests, growing tomatoes can be quite easy.  For experienced gardeners looking for a challenge, there are endless heirloom and specialty varieties to cultivate.  Tomato plants come in a range of sizes.  There are varieties that stay very small, less than 12 inches, and grow well in a pot or hanging basket on a balcony or patio.  Some grow into bushes that are a few feet high and wide, and can be grown is larger containers.  Other varieties grow into huge bushes that are several feet wide and high in a planter or garden bed.
